### Cool Project?
Got a cool project to share? Tell us about it in the [forum](https://forum.pi-top.com/c/pi-top-software)!

### Bug? Usability Issue?
#### Is It A Bug? Do We Know About it? Is It Documented?
Think you've found a bug? We're keen (though obviously not happy) to hear about it.

If it seems like quite a fundamental bug (such as an issue with updating), then check out the troubleshooting section first - we might already be aware of it or even have a solution for you! Otherwise, we ask that you check the [forum](https://forum.pi-top.com/c/pi-top-software) to see if anyone else is having the issue.

> If you are running Python code and getting an Exception, this may not be a bug.

> If you are not confident in what the issue is, then please reach out on the [forum](https://forum.pi-top.com/c/pi-top-software)!

Have you checked the documentation? For example, the [pi-top Python SDK](https://github.com/pi-top/pi-top-Python-SDK) has [documentation](http://docs.pi-top.com/).

Still think you've got a bug? Let's figure out the best place to write up your bug report.

> If you are having a bad time with pi-topOS and its software, then there is a bug.
>
> If the documentation is confusing or missing, then this is a bug.

#### Where To Submit Bug Report?
Is your bug report in relation to **Python development with pi-top hardware**? Check out the [pi-top Python SDK](https://github.com/pi-top/pi-top-Python-SDK) and [pi-top Python Common Library](https://github.com/pi-top/pi-top-Python-Common-Library) GitHub repositories.

<!-- TODO -->
<!-- Otherwise, check out Technical Details for information about how pi-topOS is organised and how to track down the appropriate GitHub repository for a bug report. Once there, be sure to check to see if there are any existing Issues and/or Pull Requests. -->

If you are unsure about where to post the issue, then create a forum post about the issue you are having so that someone can help you direct you to the best place to submit the Issue.

#### How To Submit Bug Report?
A good, well-documented bug report is the most effective way to help improve the quality of pi-top code.

Check out this [one-page checklist](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/prod.ghost.blog/blog/2018/11/Ultimate-bug-tracking-checklist_Markerio.pdf) outlining how to write a great bug report (or you can read its more thorough [accompanying blog post](https://marker.io/blog/write-bug-report)!).

Use [GitHub's Markdown](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) to style your Issue. For example, if you are providing a Python code snippet, write it like so:

````
```python
print("code here")
```
````

### Feature Suggestion?
#### Do We Know About it?
Think you've found a bug? We'd love to hear about it!

First of all, it's important to check the [forum](https://forum.pi-top.com/c/pi-top-software) and see if someone else has already had the same, or similar, idea. It is easier to prioritise work that has multiple users requesting the same thing!

#### Where To Submit Feature Suggestion?
Is your feature request in relation to **Python development with pi-top hardware**? Check out the pi-top Python SDK repository on GitHub.
