# Controlling pi-top Hardware

There are many ways to interact with hardware. However, pi-top have worked hard to offer a coherent programming experience for all.
Consequently, this has led to the development of software development kits (SDKs).

Currently, it is possible to interact with a pi-top with 2 different SDKs:

* [Python SDK](https://github.com/pi-top/pi-top-Python-SDK)
* [.NET SDK](https://github.com/pi-top/pi-top-4-.NET-SDK)

Check out the examples for each:

* Python examples
    * [Documentation Recipes](http://docs.pi-top.com/en/stable/recipes_api.html)
    * [In GitHub Repository](https://github.com/pi-top/pi-top-4-.NET)
* [.NET samples](https://github.com/pi-top/pi-top-4-.NET)
