# pi-topOS - Official Documentation

> **Please note that this documentation is currently under active construction.**
> We ask that you bear with us while we work to assemble this document!

Hello and welcome to pi-topOS's official documentation.

This is an evolving document that seeks to describe the current state of pi-topOS.
As updates are released, the way that the OS behaves will change, and so too will this document.

Where there is notable information about earlier versions (such as serious bugs and usability issues), this document
will seek to provide useful information.

> Unless you have a very specific issue, you will need to make sure that you are using the latest version of pi-topOS
and its software. Otherwise, you may find that this documentation does not accurately reflect what you are actually
using.
