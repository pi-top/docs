## Why does my screen resolution keep resetting on reboot?
`autorandr`, HDMI forced output, 

## How does pi-topOS handle versioning?
See the glossary for more information about the previous versions and their respective names.

pi-topOS is based on Raspberry Pi OS, which is based on Debian. Debian changes every \~18 months.

## Why is pi-topSPEAKER not mentioned/included in the pi-top Python SDK?

pi-topSPEAKERs are automatically configured and initialized via `pt-device-manager`. Because there are no desirable programmatic hardware settings, there is no exposed public API for this hardware.

## Why does my pi-top [4] require a modified EEPROM?

Raspberry Pi 4 boards earlier than the 1.4 PCB revision (All 8GB models have this, and this is now also the default for 2GB and 4GB models) require a modified EEPROM to power off correctly.

These newer boards hold the external reset until it is released by software (SPI bootloader) when the watchdog/soft reset occurs.

This means that the 5V rail on the USB bus will be off until the second stage bootloader has initialised or if halting it will stay off. On previous board revisions, this was not under software controls so 5V would be initialised when the XHCI/VLI automatically initialised, which could happen before halt.

Therefore, it is necessary to update the Raspberry Pi's internal EEPROM firmware to behave correctly. The following changes are made to the EEPROM:

```shell
WAKE_ON_GPIO=0
POWER_OFF_ON_HALT=1
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è There is a very small risk of damage to Raspberry Pi HATs where 5V is powered but 3V3 is off (unless the HAT is designed to support that power configuration). Check with your HAT manufacturer to find out more.
