# pi-topOS Documentation

This repository uses [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) to build
the documentation hosted at https://pi-top.github.io/docs/.

----

 Files in `src/` are available to the build. For example, `src/img/test.png` would allow you to use the following Markdown:
> ```markdown
![My Test Image](img/test.png)
```
